# WAIFU Testing Framework
### Widely Accessible Integration & Functional Unit Testing

---

I couldn't find a C testing framework with automatic test discovery, built-in mocking, 
and worked nicely with cross-compilers that didn't require complex CMake configurations or
running loads of scripts... So I've decided to write my own

Some basic features:
- Two-line configuration
- Automatic test discovery
- Trivial mock generation
- Compatible with cross-compilation setups
